## Validation

All inputs are validated with [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), ensuring data integrity and type safety in the routes.

---

## Middleware

- **Auth middleware:** validates JWT tokens on protected routes  
- **Error handling:** centralized error management for clear responses

---

## Image Uploads

Book images are managed via Cloudinary. The `POST /book` and `PUT /book/:id` routes support uploads via `multer` and save the resulting image URL.

---

## Final Notes

- The API is designed for personal use with just two users, so the user system is simple.   
- Role control is basic, with middleware protecting admin routes.  
- Passwords are securely stored with bcrypt.
